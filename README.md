# King 2008

Exercises and experiments based on the book *C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition)* by K. N. King.

From here on, we refer to the book simply as *King (2008)*.

## Purpose

This project aims to build a solid foundation in C programming by systematically completing all exercises in *King (2008)*.

## Setup

This repository uses a dedicated VS Code profile: **C (GCC + GDB, C23)** with integrated *clang-tidy* and *clang-format*.
