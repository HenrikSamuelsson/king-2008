# king-2008

Exercises and experiments from *C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition)*
by K. N. King.

## Notes

This repository uses a dedicated VS Code profile:
**C (GCC + GDB, C23)** with integrated **clang-tidy** and **clang-format**.

The purpose of this project is to learn modern, portable C by working through all exercises in *King (2008)* with clean builds, unit tests, and version control.
